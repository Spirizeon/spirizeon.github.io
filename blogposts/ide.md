Since Neovim is an infinitely extensible program, we can turn it into anything.

## Prebuilt Configs

There are many preset configurations and frameworks on the internet for instant conversion of Neovim from a basic text editor into a full-fledged IDE with all the keychains and trinkets. Like LunarVim, NvChad, and AstroVim.

### The Problem

Since these are made by some other developer, it's sometimes difficult or impossible to customise them to the user's own preference. Like disabling any feature the user doesn't want to use. They're also stressful to navigate through because of changed keymappings of features existing and totally fresh to the user.

## Basic features of an IDE

* Code autocompletion
    
* LSP support
    
* FileTree
    
* Syntax highlighting
    
* Inbuilt terminal
    
* Git integration
    
* Status bar
    
* Debugger/Linter/Formatter (They're not the same)
    

## Getting inspired

The solution is to take inspiration from everything, choose what plugins need to be there and what needs to be removed, then write a custom a `init.lua` config with the desired package manager. Here's mine that was inspired by NvChad, but is less "bloated" in comparison:
